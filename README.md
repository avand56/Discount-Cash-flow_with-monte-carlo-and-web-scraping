# Discount-Cash-flow_with-monte-carlo-and-web-scraping
This code will allow the user to scrap Yahoo finance for a ticker symbols cashflow, balance sheet and financials.
It also contains a monte carlo DCF model.
This code is currently still being written in my free time.
Steps will be taken to automate this code completely so that a ticker symbol will be input into the web scraper and a stock price will be output by the DCF algorithm
